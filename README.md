# binterpreter
A brainfuck interpreter, written in C. Is a brainduck.

Uses the standard brainduck specs.

The goal was to make a simple working interpreter, not to make it fast or fancy. Should have understandable source code.

If you want your code to run fast, look somewhere else.
Right now (as of 01/09/18) I am working on a revised version of btranspiler that would make actually efficient code, so that should run pretty fast on the gameboy.
